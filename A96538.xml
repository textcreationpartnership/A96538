            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader thou art now come to the End of this Book; let me tell thee what was the End of the Author in publiÅ¿hing it. God, in the Scripture, tells us that <hi>evil Dayes, perillous Times Å¿hall come.</hi> This is doubtleÅ¿Å¿e <hi>written for our InÅ¿truction.</hi> It's then Å¿urely the Duty of a MiniÅ¿ter of the GoÅ¿pel, to give People WARNING of theÅ¿e perillous Times, and (after the Example of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and faithful Preachers of the Word in all Ages) to give in his WITNES againÅ¿t the evil of the Dayes. This, out of <hi>FaithfulneÅ¿s</hi> to the great IntereÅ¿ts of the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Å¿ouls. The Author, upon this Ground, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embraced, what he judged his fitteÅ¿t <hi>Opportunity,</hi> for the diÅ¿charge of this Duty, that Å¿o he might have <hi>a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, both towards God, and towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170317:224"/>
            <p>Moreover, the Author obÅ¿erving with Griefe, how the generality of men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their <hi>Danger</hi> in Å¿uch perillous Times, are wont to Å¿tudy their <hi>Å¿afety</hi> by carnall <hi>Compliances</hi> with every <hi>riÅ¿ing Party,</hi> whereby when a <hi>wicked Party</hi> prevailes, it Å¿trengthens it Å¿elfe mightily to the carrying on and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliÅ¿hment of thoÅ¿e DeÅ¿ignes, which are deÅ¿tructive to the whole Nation, in the Safety or Ruine whereof particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ons and Societies muÅ¿t needs Å¿tand or fall. Thus the <hi>Trees</hi> Å¿ubmit themÅ¿elves to the <hi>Å¿cratching Bramble,</hi> and put their <hi>TruÅ¿t</hi> under its <hi>Å¿hadow,</hi> till at length <hi>Fire</hi> coming forth from it to devoure the <hi>Noble Cedars,</hi> conÅ¿umes the whole <hi>ForreÅ¿t.</hi> Such is the Folly of men, that oft-times by that very meanes whereby they Å¿eek for <hi>Safety,</hi> they runne themÅ¿elves into the greater <hi>Danger.</hi> I judg'd it my Duty therefore to endeavour a DiÅ¿covery of <hi>a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DoubtleÅ¿Å¿e here lies our greateÅ¿t <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> in our provoking God by our <hi>Å¿ins,</hi> to puniÅ¿h us and the whole Land by his <hi>Judgements.</hi> If he become our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170317:224"/> they are not men, be they never Å¿o great and mighty in Power, that can help or Å¿ave us. And by <hi>Å¿inful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances</hi> how Å¿oone may the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be involv'd in the guilt of thoÅ¿e horrid <hi>Perjuries,</hi> injurious <hi>Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> fearful <hi>Enormities,</hi> and God-provoking <hi>Abominations,</hi> which may pluck down the Å¿oreÅ¿t Plagues and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿hments upon all the People of the Land. Our onely Å¿afety then lies in making our <hi>Peace</hi> with God, by humbling our Å¿elves for all our Å¿innes, and turning to him with our whole Hearts, and Å¿o in walking humbly with him in his holy wayes, and keeping our Å¿elves cleare from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Abominations of the Times. For <hi>if God be with us, who can be againÅ¿t us?</hi> If he that is <hi>Mighty to Å¿ave</hi> be our <hi>Friend,</hi> we need not care who are our <hi>Enemies,</hi> nor feare what man can do unto us. Now this is the Scope and Drift of the preÅ¿ent TreatiÅ¿e; and to give a timely Warning of this <hi>Danger,</hi> and a Å¿eaÅ¿onable Admonition of this <hi>Duty,</hi> was the DeÅ¿igne, and is the DeÅ¿ire of the Author.</p>
            <p>For this ReaÅ¿on and end therefore was
<pb facs="tcp:170317:225"/> this <hi>Sermon</hi> firÅ¿t preached, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the <hi>Advice</hi> of many of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brethren, the Ministers of the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the City of <hi>London,</hi> was this <hi>DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e</hi> publiÅ¿hed. If thou deÅ¿ireÅ¿t to know what was at the firÅ¿t preached in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and hath been Å¿ince added in the <hi>DiÅ¿courÅ¿e,</hi> which hath Å¿welled it to this BigneÅ¿Å¿e, take this Account. The Sermon mainly conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of theÅ¿e two things; the <hi>Symptomes</hi> of perillous Times, and the <hi>Duty</hi> of the Saints in Å¿uch Dayes of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For the former; thoÅ¿e Å¿even Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes were laid down, which according to the Order wherein now thou findeÅ¿t them, are the third, fourth, fift, Å¿ixt, eighth, ninth and laÅ¿t. For the latter; the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd Duties onely were preÅ¿t, and therein principally the fift Branch of the Å¿econd Duty. AlmoÅ¿t all the rest, with Å¿undry illuÅ¿trative Enlargements of theÅ¿e, are added in this TreatiÅ¿e, that it might, by the BleÅ¿Å¿ing of God, become of more <hi>General UÅ¿efulneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> This AdvertiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have added for thy Å¿atisfaction, which I Å¿hall conclude with this Caution; <hi>Take heed thou art not one of them that make the Times perillous.</hi> By
<pb facs="tcp:170317:225"/> a Å¿erious PeruÅ¿al of the fore-going DiÅ¿courÅ¿e, and a Religious Reflexion upon thy Å¿elfe, thou mayeÅ¿t come to know whether thou art on Gods Å¿ide or againÅ¿t him. But Å¿ee thou do thy Å¿elf no <hi>Hurt</hi> by what's meant for thy <hi>Good.</hi> Harden not thy Å¿elfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t the Admonitions given thee in the Name of the Lord. For, Know; the BOOK in thy hand, however <hi>buried</hi> in Contempt, will <hi>riÅ¿e</hi> up in Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t many <hi>Great Ones,</hi> many <hi>Guilty Ones</hi> in this Nation, at the laÅ¿t Day; whoÅ¿e guilt will be aggravated by their Å¿lighting of this timely Warning, given them by</p>

O that it would pleaÅ¿e thee to make uÅ¿e of this poor thing, as an <hi>InÅ¿trument</hi> in thine own hand, for the Glory of thy great Name, and the good of thy People, in this Å¿inful Nation! Oh let not the <hi>WeakneÅ¿Å¿es</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> of thy Å¿ervant, that herein diÅ¿cloÅ¿e themÅ¿elves, hinder the <hi>Å¿ucceÅ¿s</hi> of this Å¿mall <hi>Å¿ervice,</hi> which he deÅ¿ires hereby to do thy diÅ¿tracted
<pb facs="tcp:170317:226"/> Church. Lord, own and accept what is <hi>Good</hi> in it, for it is thine own: but what is <hi>Evil,</hi> pardon and cover, as proceeding from the weakneÅ¿Å¿e of a poor Creature, that would willingly do thee much better Å¿ervice, and yet is willing to Å¿ubmit to thy Will, though Thou Å¿houldeÅ¿t Å¿ubject him to the meaneÅ¿t employment. And give, O Lord, Å¿o much <hi>Charity</hi> to his dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they may <hi>cover the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of their poor weak Brother in <hi>Love;</hi> and not Å¿eek to <hi>hurt</hi> him, by that whereby he deÅ¿ires to do others <hi>Good.</hi> Oh that thou wouldeÅ¿t be pleaÅ¿ed to put it into their Hearts, from the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of thy poor Å¿ervants Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿es, to take an occaÅ¿ion to adore the Riches of thy <hi>free Grace,</hi> and to exalt thy Name with <hi>PraiÅ¿es,</hi> for that thou haÅ¿t been pleaÅ¿ed to intruÅ¿t them with more <hi>excellent Abilities</hi> for thy Å¿ervice! So Å¿hall thy Å¿ervant have cauÅ¿e to <hi>glory in his Infirmities,</hi> when thereby Å¿ome <hi>Glory</hi> Å¿hall redound to thy Name.</p>
            <p>But as for the <hi>Proud,</hi> who make it their Glory to oppreÅ¿Å¿e the <hi>Poor,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170317:227"/> keep thy Å¿ervant ever in that ReÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to which by thy grace thou haÅ¿t raiÅ¿ed his heart, rather to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿h by their Power, then by any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Compliance,</hi> to Å¿eek his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervation or Advantage, to thy DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.

Make thy Å¿ervant one of them, <hi>in whoÅ¿e Eyes a vile PerÅ¿on is contemned,</hi> how Great or Glorious Å¿oever he be in the World's eye; but let him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>honour them that feare the LORD.</hi> Let not thy Å¿ervant think it Å¿trange if he Å¿uffer <hi>Reproach</hi> from them, that caÅ¿t <hi>DiÅ¿honour</hi> upon Thee; but rather rejoyce in their Reproaches, as the <hi>Badges of his FaithfulneÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and weare them as his <hi>Crown</hi> and Glory. Let him not Å¿tudy <hi>to pleaÅ¿e men,</hi> leÅ¿t he looÅ¿e the Honour of being <hi>the Å¿ervant of ChriÅ¿t.</hi> Oh let thy Å¿ervant behold <hi>Smiles</hi> in thy pleaÅ¿ed Face, and taÅ¿t the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of thy precious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿es,</hi> and Å¿o Å¿hall he not fear the <hi>Frownes,</hi> nor regard the <hi>Threats</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:170317:227"/> Proud, Perfidious, and PreÅ¿umptuous Å¿inners. Let him never deÅ¿ire to have them for his <hi>Friends,</hi> who by their horrid Enormities have made God their <hi>Enemy.</hi> Let him never Å¿eek to be <hi>eÅ¿teemed</hi> by them, whoÅ¿e <hi>InÅ¿olencies</hi> proclaime to the world that they <hi>contemne</hi> God. Yet, Oh that thou wouldeÅ¿t open their Eyes to Å¿ee their Å¿ins, before thou tumble them from their Earthly Glory into Hell! Oh that in Å¿tead of accounting thy Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant their <hi>Enemy for telling them the Truth,</hi> they might Å¿ee and conÅ¿ider that it is the higheÅ¿t act of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip</hi> to Å¿hew them their <hi>Danger</hi> before it be too late. Oh that it would pleaÅ¿e thee by thy Spirit, to convince them of thoÅ¿e Å¿ins, and fearful abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, which thy Å¿ervant hath endeavour'd herein to repreÅ¿ent, as in a <hi>GlaÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> before their faces! Oh give them to repent of their <hi>wicked Deeds,</hi> and to humble themÅ¿elves for their <hi>inÅ¿olent Actings.</hi> However, Lord, by thy powerful Providence <hi>reÅ¿train</hi> them in their wayes of wickedneÅ¿Å¿e, whoÅ¿e <hi>Ambitious</hi> and <hi>aÅ¿piring Å¿pirits</hi> prompt

            <p>And vouchÅ¿afe, O God, to look down from thy high and holy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, upon this Å¿inful Land; but not with an <hi>Eye of Fury</hi> and Revenge, but with an <hi>Eye of Mercy</hi> and Love. Thou Å¿eeÅ¿t what <hi>fearful Abominations</hi> are committed amongÅ¿t us: Thou knoweÅ¿t what <hi>perillous Times</hi> are come upon us. Thou Å¿eeÅ¿t how cruel enemies do rend the body of thy dear Å¿onne, the CHURCH, which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with his own blood. Thou heareÅ¿t with what helliÅ¿h <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>BlaÅ¿phemies</hi> vile Creatures daily teare thy Å¿acred and glorious Name. Oh! If thou waÅ¿t not infinite in Mercy and Patience, thou hadÅ¿t long ago rain'd down <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>BrimÅ¿tone</hi> upon our heads, or involv'd the whole

            </p>
            <p>But now, O Lord, <hi>hear;</hi> O Lord, <hi>have Mercy;</hi> O Lord, <hi>forgive</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great Å¿ins and Provocations of this Land, and do not <hi>forÅ¿ake</hi> us utterly, nor irreÅ¿iÅ¿tibly <hi>deÅ¿troy</hi> us, as we have deÅ¿erved. We muÅ¿t needs confeÅ¿Å¿e that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>our Princes</hi> have greatly Å¿inned againÅ¿t thee, and fearfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the pure Eyes of thy Glory. Lord humble us from the <hi>higheÅ¿t</hi> to the <hi>loweÅ¿t;</hi> give us a true <hi>Repentance</hi> for all our Å¿ins, and <hi>Grace</hi> to turne to thee our God with our whole hearts, and Å¿o <hi>Å¿pare</hi> us, and <hi>heale</hi> our Land. Oh Å¿tirre thy people up to thoÅ¿e <hi>Å¿pecial Duties,</hi> which are at this Time in a Å¿pecial manner incumbent on them. Let this <hi>Warning</hi> and <hi>Call</hi> which thou giveÅ¿t them by the hand of thy Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, become, through thy BleÅ¿Å¿ing, effectual for the <hi>Awakening</hi> of thy Å¿ervants out of their Security, and the <hi>Engaging</hi> of them to thoÅ¿e Duties, whereby thy Wrath and Judgements may be prevented, and a <hi>wide Door</hi> may
<pb facs="tcp:170317:229"/> be opened, whereby thy BleÅ¿Å¿ings may flow in abundantly upon us. O Good God, puniÅ¿h not this Land with a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of thy VVord.</hi> Oh take not thy GoÅ¿pel &amp; Ordinances from us; Remove not thy <hi>golden CandleÅ¿tick.</hi> Oh never let it be Å¿aid, <hi>The Glory is departed from England!</hi> It were better for us to Å¿ee our Å¿treets runne downe with the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Å¿laine, and to behold the <hi>Bodies</hi> of thy Saints <hi>burnt</hi> in flames, then to live in peace, and grow cold in our love to thy Truth, till we have utterly loÅ¿t the GoÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Prayers put up in <hi>Flames</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> might recall it againe, when a general <hi>Å¿loth</hi> and <hi>Å¿ecurity</hi> in Å¿inne, may forfeit it for ever. But, O Lord, continue thy <hi>GoÅ¿pel,</hi> preÅ¿erve thy <hi>People,</hi> and bleÅ¿Å¿e thine <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> in the Land. But if for our <hi>Å¿innes,</hi> thou Å¿halt Å¿uffer thoÅ¿e <hi>Å¿tormes</hi> to ariÅ¿e, whereby thy Church Å¿hall Å¿uffer <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> Oh let this poor <hi>Plank</hi> caÅ¿t out by the hand of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Å¿ervant, be a Meanes to Å¿ave Å¿ome Soules. Oh let this Å¿mall <hi>Light</hi> direct Å¿ome Å¿oules in
<pb facs="tcp:170317:229"/> the right Path, for their eternal Salvation, to the Glory of thy free Grace, through the Lord <hi>JeÅ¿us,</hi> our onely Mediator and Redeemer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
