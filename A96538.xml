            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thus it nearly concerns all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to take ſpecial notice of theſe Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of perillous Times, that they may make a good improvement thereof for their ſpiritual advantage.</p>
               <p>But now the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel are in a ſpecial manner concern'd herein.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is indeed very <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for us to know when theſe <hi>perillous Times</hi> are come upon us, that we may be both more <hi>watchful</hi> againſt the <hi>Danger,</hi> and <hi>careful</hi> of the <hi>Duty,</hi> at ſuch Times in a ſpecial manner incumbent on us. No dangers are ſo great as theirs, that neither ſee nor perceive their Dangers.

Great is the danger of thoſe who live in <hi>Perillous Times</hi> without ſuſpition of <hi>Danger.</hi> Woe be to them who ſhall be <hi>ſurpriz'd</hi> by the Judgements of God, ariſing, as it were, out of <hi>Ambuſh</hi> againſt them. Its very neceſſary therefore for all Chriſtians to conſider whether the Dayes wherein they live are the <hi>Perillous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170317:20"/> Times,</hi> whereof they are fore-warn'd in the Prophecies of the holy Scriptures, or not.</p>
               <p>Now we may know when theſe perillous Times are come, by conſidering the <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

When we ſee men continue in their ſinnes, and daily grow to a greater <hi>height of Wickedneſſe,</hi> we have then cauſe to fear the Times will grow worſe rather then better. And therefore in this Caſe, the People of God had need be very earneſt and importunate with God in their Prayers, leſt the <hi>Provocations</hi> of the wicked ſhould be more prevailing for the bringing down of the Judgements of God, then the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of his People for the <hi>Prevention</hi> of thoſe <hi>Judgements,</hi> and the <hi>Procurement</hi> of his <hi>Mercies,</hi> upon the Land. When the ſins of the Land cry aloud for <hi>Judgment,</hi> the Saints of God had need to cry aloud for <hi>Mercy.</hi> The <hi>Prayer of Faith</hi> is the moſt effectual means, by Gods own appointment for the <hi>Removal</hi> of evils felt, the <hi>Prevention</hi> of evils feared, and the <hi>Procurement</hi> of good things deſired. There is not therefore a
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:170317:199"/> more ſad <hi>Symptome</hi> of the approach of ſome dreadful Judgement then the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. Thus when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provoked God, by cuſtomary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>groſſe ſinnes</hi> after <hi>glorious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances,</hi> as Theft, Murder, Adultery, Perjury, Idolatry; and had extreamly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated theſe ſins by <hi>pretences of Religion</hi> and godlineſſe; (For they would <hi>come and ſtand before the LORD in his Houſe, as if they ſhould ſay, We are deliver'd to do all theſe Abominations,</hi> as the Lord hath teſtifi'd againſt them by his Prophet<note n="*" place="margin">Jer. 7.9, 10</note>) and when thereupon God purpoſed to caſt them off for their ſins, he forbad his Prophet to pray for them.

While a <hi>Praying Spirit</hi> is kept up in the hearts of Gods people, there is hopes of prevailing with God for mercy for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nation. Prayer does as it were binde up the hands of <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> that an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended God cannot inflict a deſerved Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon a provoking People. And therefore when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had made
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:170317:200"/> them a <hi>Molten Calf,</hi> and worſhipped it, and the wrath of God was kindled againſt them to deſtroy them, <hi>Moſes</hi> by his <hi>Prayer</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their Deſtruction. And therefore did the Lord ſpeak thus to <hi>Moſes;</hi>

When <hi>Mettal</hi> is melted, it bears the figure of the Mould into which it is caſt. Indeed in God the immutable <hi>Pattern</hi> of all <hi>Perfections,</hi> Love is of a more tranſcendent Nature and Efficacy in all its operations. God by loving us <hi>aſſimilates</hi> us to himſelf; but we by loving God, are <hi>aſſimilated</hi> to him. For this <hi>Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milating motion</hi> of Love ſprings from the <hi>Quickering Motive</hi> thereof, which gives Life, Vigour and Activity to Love. Now the <hi>Motive</hi> of our Love to God, is in him: but the <hi>Motive</hi> of Gods Love to us, is not in us, but in himſelf. 'Tis a <hi>Flower</hi> that ſprings from the <hi>Root</hi> of free Grace. But now this <hi>Conformity</hi> to God in the <hi>Beauty of Holineſs</hi> being produc'd by the Efficacy of theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Graces, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> muſt needs evidence the ſouls <hi>Intereſt</hi> in God. 'Tis <hi>Grace</hi> flowing from God to the ſoul, which raiſes the ſoul up to a <hi>Conformity</hi> to God, and his
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:170317:204"/> Will revealed in his Holy Word. And <hi>Communication</hi> of Grace ſpeaks the ſouls <hi>Intereſt</hi> in God. If the <hi>Branch</hi> flouriſh by Virtue of ſap derived from the <hi>Stock,</hi> it is certainly ingraffed thereinto.</p>
                        <p>Now doth your ſoul reſt upon God in a way of <hi>Believing?</hi> Doth your Heart go out after God in a way of loving? Do you expreſs a <hi>Conformity</hi> to God, and his Will revealed in his Word, in a way of <hi>Holy Living?</hi> Doth your <hi>Faith</hi> work by <hi>Love?</hi> Doth your <hi>Love</hi> produce <hi>Likeneſs?</hi> Doth this <hi>Likeneſs</hi> nouriſh your <hi>Love?</hi> Doth this <hi>Love</hi> ſtrengthen your Faith?

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader thou art now come to the End of this Book; let me tell thee what was the End of the Author in publiſhing it. God, in the Scripture, tells us that <hi>evil Dayes, perillous Times ſhall come.</hi> This is doubtleſſe <hi>written for our Inſtruction.</hi> It's then ſurely the Duty of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, to give People WARNING of theſe perillous Times, and (after the Example of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and faithful Preachers of the Word in all Ages) to give in his WITNES againſt the evil of the Dayes. This, out of <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> to the great Intereſts of the Glory of God, and the Salvation of ſouls. The Author, upon this Ground, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embraced, what he judged his fitteſt <hi>Opportunity,</hi> for the diſcharge of this Duty, that ſo he might have <hi>a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, both towards God, and towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170317:224"/>
            <p>Moreover, the Author obſerving with Griefe, how the generality of men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their <hi>Danger</hi> in ſuch perillous Times, are wont to ſtudy their <hi>ſafety</hi> by carnall <hi>Compliances</hi> with every <hi>riſing Party,</hi> whereby when a <hi>wicked Party</hi> prevailes, it ſtrengthens it ſelfe mightily to the carrying on and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thoſe Deſignes, which are deſtructive to the whole Nation, in the Safety or Ruine whereof particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Societies muſt needs ſtand or fall. Thus the <hi>Trees</hi> ſubmit themſelves to the <hi>ſcratching Bramble,</hi> and put their <hi>Truſt</hi> under its <hi>ſhadow,</hi> till at length <hi>Fire</hi> coming forth from it to devoure the <hi>Noble Cedars,</hi> conſumes the whole <hi>Forreſt.</hi> Such is the Folly of men, that oft-times by that very meanes whereby they ſeek for <hi>Safety,</hi> they runne themſelves into the greater <hi>Danger.</hi> I judg'd it my Duty therefore to endeavour a Diſcovery of <hi>a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſſe here lies our greateſt <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi> in our provoking God by our <hi>ſins,</hi> to puniſh us and the whole Land by his <hi>Judgements.</hi> If he become our <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170317:224"/> they are not men, be they never ſo great and mighty in Power, that can help or ſave us.

Our onely ſafety then lies in making our <hi>Peace</hi> with God, by humbling our ſelves for all our ſinnes, and turning to him with our whole Hearts, and ſo in walking humbly with him in his holy wayes, and keeping our ſelves cleare from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Abominations of the Times. For <hi>if God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> If he that is <hi>Mighty to ſave</hi> be our <hi>Friend,</hi> we need not care who are our <hi>Enemies,</hi> nor feare what man can do unto us. Now this is the Scope and Drift of the preſent Treatiſe; and to give a timely Warning of this <hi>Danger,</hi> and a ſeaſonable Admonition of this <hi>Duty,</hi> was the Deſigne, and is the Deſire of the Author.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170317:225"/> this <hi>Sermon</hi> firſt preached, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the <hi>Advice</hi> of many of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brethren, the Ministers of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the City of <hi>London,</hi> was this <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> publiſhed. If thou deſireſt to know what was at the firſt preached in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and hath been ſince added in the <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> which hath ſwelled it to this Bigneſſe, take this Account. The Sermon mainly conſiſted of theſe two things; the <hi>Symptomes</hi> of perillous Times, and the <hi>Duty</hi> of the Saints in ſuch Dayes of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For the former; thoſe ſeven Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes were laid down, which according to the Order wherein now thou findeſt them, are the third, fourth, fift, ſixt, eighth, ninth and laſt. For the latter; the firſt and ſecond Duties onely were preſt, and therein principally the fift Branch of the ſecond Duty. Almoſt all the rest, with ſundry illuſtrative Enlargements of theſe, are added in this Treatiſe, that it might, by the Bleſſing of God, become of more <hi>General Uſefulneſſe.</hi> This Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have added for thy ſatisfaction, which I ſhall conclude with this Caution; <hi>Take heed thou art not one of them that make the Times perillous.</hi> By
<pb facs="tcp:170317:225"/> a ſerious Peruſal of the fore-going Diſcourſe, and a Religious Reflexion upon thy ſelfe, thou mayeſt come to know whether thou art on Gods ſide or againſt him. But ſee thou do thy ſelf no <hi>Hurt</hi> by what's meant for thy <hi>Good.</hi> Harden not thy ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Admonitions given thee in the Name of the Lord. For, Know; the BOOK in thy hand, however <hi>buried</hi> in Contempt, will <hi>riſe</hi> up in Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt many <hi>Great Ones,</hi> many <hi>Guilty Ones</hi> in this Nation, at the laſt Day; whoſe guilt will be aggravated by their ſlighting of this timely Warning, given them by</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>LORIOUS GOD, This poor thing, which thy unworthy ſervant hath <hi>finiſh't</hi> in thy <hi>ſtrength,</hi> is now <hi>preſt</hi> for thy <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> And behold I have here brought it before thy Majeſty, that it may receive thy <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> Thou, who art the great God, delighteſt to do great things by <hi>weak Means,</hi> that thy Power may appear, and thy Name may have the Glory. O that it would pleaſe thee to make uſe of this poor thing, as an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> in thine own hand, for the Glory of thy great Name, and the good of thy People, in this ſinful Nation! Oh let not the <hi>Weakneſſes</hi> and <hi>Infirmities</hi> of thy ſervant, that herein diſcloſe themſelves, hinder the <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of this ſmall <hi>ſervice,</hi> which he deſires hereby to do thy diſtracted
<pb facs="tcp:170317:226"/> Church. Lord, own and accept what is <hi>Good</hi> in it, for it is thine own: but what is <hi>Evil,</hi> pardon and cover, as proceeding from the weakneſſe of a poor Creature, that would willingly do thee much better ſervice, and yet is willing to ſubmit to thy Will, though Thou ſhouldeſt ſubject him to the meaneſt employment. And give, O Lord, ſo much <hi>Charity</hi> to his dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they may <hi>cover the Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of their poor weak Brother in <hi>Love;</hi> and not ſeek to <hi>hurt</hi> him, by that whereby he deſires to do others <hi>Good.</hi> Oh that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed to put it into their Hearts, from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of thy poor ſervants Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, to take an occaſion to adore the Riches of thy <hi>free Grace,</hi> and to exalt thy Name with <hi>Praiſes,</hi> for that thou haſt been pleaſed to intruſt them with more <hi>excellent Abilities</hi> for thy ſervice! So ſhall thy ſervant have cauſe to <hi>glory in his Infirmities,</hi> when thereby ſome <hi>Glory</hi> ſhall redound to thy Name.</p>
            <p>But as for the <hi>Proud,</hi> who make it their Glory to oppreſſe the <hi>Poor,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170317:227"/> keep thy ſervant ever in that Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, to which by thy grace thou haſt raiſed his heart, rather to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by their Power, then by any <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Compliance,</hi> to ſeek his own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation or Advantage, to thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour. Fill his Heart, and the Hearts of all thy faithful ſervants, with a <hi>holy Contempt</hi> and <hi>Scorne</hi> of their Favour, whoſe <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is flat <hi>Enmity</hi> with God. Make thy ſervant one of them, <hi>in whoſe Eyes a vile Perſon is contemned,</hi> how Great or Glorious ſoever he be in the World's eye; but let him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>honour them that feare the LORD.</hi> Let not thy ſervant think it ſtrange if he ſuffer <hi>Reproach</hi> from them, that caſt <hi>Diſhonour</hi> upon Thee; but rather rejoyce in their Reproaches, as the <hi>Badges of his Faithfulneſſe,</hi> and weare them as his <hi>Crown</hi> and Glory. Let him not ſtudy <hi>to pleaſe men,</hi> leſt he looſe the Honour of being <hi>the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> Oh let thy ſervant behold <hi>Smiles</hi> in thy pleaſed Face, and taſt the ſweetneſſe of thy precious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> and ſo ſhall he not fear the <hi>Frownes,</hi> nor regard the <hi>Threats</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:170317:227"/> Proud, Perfidious, and Preſumptuous ſinners. Let him never deſire to have them for his <hi>Friends,</hi> who by their horrid Enormities have made God their <hi>Enemy.</hi> Let him never ſeek to be <hi>eſteemed</hi> by them, whoſe <hi>Inſolencies</hi> proclaime to the world that they <hi>contemne</hi> God. Yet, Oh that thou wouldeſt open their Eyes to ſee their ſins, before thou tumble them from their Earthly Glory into Hell! Oh that in ſtead of accounting thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant their <hi>Enemy for telling them the Truth,</hi> they might ſee and conſider that it is the higheſt act of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> to ſhew them their <hi>Danger</hi> before it be too late. Oh that it would pleaſe thee by thy Spirit, to convince them of thoſe ſins, and fearful abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, which thy ſervant hath endeavour'd herein to repreſent, as in a <hi>Glaſſe,</hi> before their faces! Oh give them to repent of their <hi>wicked Deeds,</hi> and to humble themſelves for their <hi>inſolent Actings.</hi> However, Lord, by thy powerful Providence <hi>reſtrain</hi> them in their wayes of wickedneſſe, whoſe <hi>Ambitious</hi> and <hi>aſpiring ſpirits</hi> prompt
<pb facs="tcp:170317:228"/> them to the moſt <hi>Audacious</hi> and <hi>ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Actings,</hi> for the ſecuring of their own <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and the Eſtabliſhment of their own <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> upon the Ruines of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; reſtrain them, O Lord, loſt they pluck down <hi>Judgements</hi> not onely upon their own heads, but alſo on the too guilty Nation.</p>
            <p>And vouchſafe, O God, to look down from thy high and holy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, upon this ſinful Land; but not with an <hi>Eye of Fury</hi> and Revenge, but with an <hi>Eye of Mercy</hi> and Love. Thou ſeeſt what <hi>fearful Abominations</hi> are committed amongſt us: Thou knoweſt what <hi>perillous Times</hi> are come upon us. Thou ſeeſt how cruel enemies do rend the body of thy dear ſonne, the CHURCH, which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with his own blood. Thou heareſt with what helliſh <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> vile Creatures daily teare thy ſacred and glorious Name. Oh! If thou waſt not infinite in Mercy and Patience, thou hadſt long ago rain'd down <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone</hi> upon our heads, or involv'd the whole
<pb facs="tcp:170317:228"/> Land in <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Blood. It is of the Lords mercies we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, O Lord, <hi>hear;</hi> O Lord, <hi>have Mercy;</hi> O Lord, <hi>forgive</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and great ſins and Provocations of this Land, and do not <hi>forſake</hi> us utterly, nor irreſiſtibly <hi>deſtroy</hi> us, as we have deſerved. We muſt needs confeſſe that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>our Princes</hi> have greatly ſinned againſt thee, and fearfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the pure Eyes of thy Glory. Lord humble us from the <hi>higheſt</hi> to the <hi>loweſt;</hi> give us a true <hi>Repentance</hi> for all our ſins, and <hi>Grace</hi> to turne to thee our God with our whole hearts, and ſo <hi>ſpare</hi> us, and <hi>heale</hi> our Land. Oh ſtirre thy people up to thoſe <hi>ſpecial Duties,</hi> which are at this Time in a ſpecial manner incumbent on them. Let this <hi>Warning</hi> and <hi>Call</hi> which thou giveſt them by the hand of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, become, through thy Bleſſing, effectual for the <hi>Awakening</hi> of thy ſervants out of their Security, and the <hi>Engaging</hi> of them to thoſe Duties, whereby thy Wrath and Judgements may be prevented, and a <hi>wide Door</hi> may
<pb facs="tcp:170317:229"/> be opened, whereby thy Bleſſings may flow in abundantly upon us. O Good God, puniſh not this Land with a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of thy VVord.</hi> Oh take not thy Goſpel &amp; Ordinances from us; Remove not thy <hi>golden Candleſtick.</hi> Oh never let it be ſaid, <hi>The Glory is departed from England!</hi> It were better for us to ſee our ſtreets runne downe with the <hi>Blood</hi> of the ſlaine, and to behold the <hi>Bodies</hi> of thy Saints <hi>burnt</hi> in flames, then to live in peace, and grow cold in our love to thy Truth, till we have utterly loſt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Prayers put up in <hi>Flames</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> might recall it againe, when a general <hi>ſloth</hi> and <hi>ſecurity</hi> in ſinne, may forfeit it for ever. But, O Lord, continue thy <hi>Goſpel,</hi> preſerve thy <hi>People,</hi> and bleſſe thine <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> in the Land. But if for our <hi>ſinnes,</hi> thou ſhalt ſuffer thoſe <hi>ſtormes</hi> to ariſe, whereby thy Church ſhall ſuffer <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> Oh let this poor <hi>Plank</hi> caſt out by the hand of thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſervant, be a Meanes to ſave ſome Soules. Oh let this ſmall <hi>Light</hi> direct ſome ſoules in
<pb facs="tcp:170317:229"/> the right Path, for their eternal Salvation, to the Glory of thy free Grace, through the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> our onely Mediator and Redeemer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
